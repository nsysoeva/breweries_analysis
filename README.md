# Breweries Analysis

### Problem Area

In many countries across the globe, small businesses act as a backbone of the economy, providing jobs, goods, and services. In order to open a small business, a careful research into potential product and market characteristics needs to be performed, to ensure the endeavour is successful.

Micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (commonly abbreviated as SMEs) are responsible for more than two thirds of all jobs worldwide. SMEs also account for the majority of new job creation. Small businesses focus on customer experience, stimulate local economy, often have lower  environmental impact (through shorter transportation distances), create jobs, and facilitate local community building (through paying local and state taxes and engaging in local charities and nonprofits).

Craft beer industry has gained popularity globally in recent years and is continuing to expand. It is a local industry, which needs to be analyzed location-by-location due to its nature.

Only in the U.S. there were 1,813 craft breweries in operation in 2010. While the US industry has experienced growth over the years, the 2020 sales were down 10% from 2019 due to the pandemic. In 2021, number of breweries in the US was over 9,000. While the industry overall has seen an encouraging trend, in the US, the sales in 2021/2022 were still lagging pre-pandemic levels, with brewery closings ticking up.  

In Canada, following the pandemic the craft breweries have had a tough time. B.C.'s once-booming craft beer industry faces significant challenges: demographic changes, rising costs, and looming repayment deadlines for government pandemic loans. The industry association representing B.C. craft breweries says up to 15% of its members could face closure next year, if they donâ€™t get extensions on pandemic support loans.

Overall, customers are demanding more unique tastes and the breweries continuing to reinvent themselves to fit the new demographic (incorporating non-beer offering and expanding non-alchogolic beer offerings).

Because the global craft beer industry has grown significantly in the recent dacade (resulting in more competition in the market) and due to still significant post-pandemiuc challenges, it is key to carefully consider the economics before opening a brewery. Determining product pricing is one of the crucial components towards calculating its profitability. Our analysis will be focused on determining price per liter of based on a variety of beer characteristics. With such analysis, we will help up incoming entepreneurs in their journey towards competitively pricing their beer offering on the market.

### Data Science Solution

Data science solution for this problem is to build a few statistical models in order to determine per liter price of beer. I am planning on using linear regression, decision tree, random forest,and XGBoost. I would train the model on training data (80% of the total data) and will test it on testing data (the remaining 20%).
