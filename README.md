# Breweries Analysis

### Problem Area

In many countries across the globe, small businesses act as a backbone of the economy, providing jobs, goods, and services. In order to open a small business, a careful research into potential product and market characteristics needs to be performed, to ensure the endeavour is successful.

Micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (commonly abbreviated as SMEs) are responsible for more than two thirds of all jobs worldwide. SMEs also account for the majority of new job creation.

Craft beer industry has gained popularity globally and it is continuing to expand. Only in the U.S. there were 1,813 craft breweries in operation in 2010. In 2021, that number rose to well over 9,000. Customers are demanding more unique tastes and supporting local businesses, which contributes to the success. We look at a synthetic dataset of craft breweries in Bangalore, India. 

Because the global craft beer industry has grown significantly in the recent years, it is key to carefully consider the economics before opening a brewer. Determining product pricing is one of the crucial components towards calculating its profitability â€“ we will set price per unit as our target variable. The dataset provides brewing parameters, sales data, and quality assessments; we will help brewers to appropriately price beer they produce.
