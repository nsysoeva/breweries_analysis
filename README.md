# Breweries Analysis

### Problem Area

In many countries across the globe, small businesses act as a backbone of the economy, providing jobs, goods, and services. In order to open a small business, a careful research into potential product and market characteristics needs to be performed, to ensure the endeavour is successful.

Micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (commonly abbreviated as SMEs) are responsible for more than two thirds of all jobs worldwide. SMEs also account for the majority of new job creation. Small businesses focus on customer experience, stimulate local economy, often have lower  environmental impact (through shorter transportation distances), create jobs, and facilitate local community building (through paying local and state taxes and engaging in local charities and nonprofits).

Craft beer industry has gained popularity globally in recent years and is continuing to expand. Only in the U.S. there were 1,813 craft breweries in operation in 2010. In 2021, that number rose to well over 9,000. 

In Canada, following the pandemic the craft breweries have had a tough time. B.C.'s once-booming craft beer industry faces significant challenges: demographic changes, rising costs, and looming repayment deadlines for government pandemic loans.
  - The industry association representing B.C. craft breweries says up to 15 per cent of its members could face closure next year, if they don’t get extensions on pandemic support loans.

Customers are demanding more unique tastes and are supporting local businesses, which contributes to the success.

Because the global craft beer industry has grown significantly in the recent years, it is key to carefully consider the economics before opening a brewery. Determining product pricing is one of the crucial components towards calculating its profitability – we will set price per unit as the target variable in our analysis. The dataset provides brewing parameters, sales data, and quality assessments; we will help brewers to appropriately price beer they produce.
